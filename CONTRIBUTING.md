### [Opening an issue](https://github.com/RusticCoder/cimerant/issues)

If you encounter a bug in an open source project, check if the bug has already been reported. If the bug has not been reported, you can open an issue to report the bug according to the project's contribution guidelines.

Before reporting a bug please make every effort to resolve the problem yourself.
